# 🧠 Deep Learning Theory — With Code

This repository is my **deep dive into the theory of Deep Learning (DL)**, where I take important concepts from books, papers, and lectures, and implement them step by step in code.  

The purpose of this repo is to **connect theory with practice**:  
- Understand the math and intuition behind DL algorithms.  
- Translate the equations into clean and simple code.  
- Build a strong foundation that can support advanced research and applied projects.  

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Strengthen my **understanding of deep learning theory**.  
- Implement core concepts directly from scratch in **Python / PyTorch / TensorFlow**.  
- Bridge the gap between **mathematical formulas** and **working code**.  
- Build a portfolio of **theory-backed implementations** useful for interviews and research.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder/topic contains:
- 📄 **Theory Notes** (math formulas, derivations, intuition)  
- 💻 **Code Implementation** (step-by-step from scratch)  
- 📊 **Examples / Experiments**  
- ✅ **Validation / Tests** to check correctness  

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (Growing List)
- Artificial Neurons & Activation Functions  
- Forward & Backpropagation  
- Gradient Descent & Optimization Algorithms  
- Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs)  
- Regularization (Dropout, BatchNorm, Weight Decay)  
- Advanced Topics (Attention, Transformers, etc.)

## ⚠️ Note
This is a **learning-first repository**.  
- Code may be experimental or simplified for clarity.  
- Some derivations are written quickly; improvements will be added later.  
- Focus is on **clarity & correctness**, not production-ready pipelines.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Highlighted
- Translating math → code  
- Implementing DL algorithms from scratch  
- Understanding **why models work, not just how to run them**  
- Writing clean, interview-ready code with theory references  

---

## 🌟 Future Plans
- Add **visual explanations** for each concept.  
- Expand to **Transformers & modern architectures**.  
- Create **Jupyter notebooks** combining math, text, and code for teaching.
