# Deep Learning Theory — From Scratch

> **Goal:** Explore and implement every major Deep Learning concept **from first principles** — fully coded from scratch in Python and NumPy (with optional PyTorch verification).  
> This repository serves as a foundation for understanding how deep neural networks learn, optimize, and generalize — not by using frameworks, but by **recreating them** from the ground up.

##  Vision

This project extends my machine learning theory work into the **deep learning domain** — rebuilding modern neural architectures from core mathematical and computational principles.  
The goal is to understand the **why and how** behind deep models: what makes them converge, fail, or generalize.

Every notebook is a **controlled experiment**:
- Derive → Implement → Visualize → Compare → Interpret  
- Study gradients, activations, optimization paths, and architecture behavior  
- Analyze the effects of initialization, normalization, and depth  

---

##  Technical Stack

- **Python + NumPy** for low-level implementation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter / Colab** for experimentation  
- **PyTorch (optional)** for verification and benchmarking

##  Methodology

1. **Mathematical Foundation:**  
   Each experiment starts with the theoretical formulation of the objective, forward pass, and gradient derivations.

2. **From Scratch Implementation:**  
   Build neural components manually (no high-level frameworks), focusing on tensor algebra and autograd logic.

3. **Visualization & Debugging:**  
   Track activations, gradients, and weight updates to understand model dynamics.

4. **Experimental Verification:**  
   Compare against PyTorch or TensorFlow implementations for accuracy and performance parity.

5. **Iterative Exploration:**  
   Modify and test architectural variants to study behavior under different loss, activation, or optimization settings.

## Research Direction

This repository is part of a broader effort to build **theoretical and experimental fluency** in:
- Backpropagation and gradient mechanics  
- Optimization landscapes and convergence theory  
- Neural architecture design and inductive bias  
- Regularization, normalization, and generalization phenomena  
- Representation learning and information bottleneck theory  

The long-term objective is to evolve these foundations into **self-improving deep learning systems**, capable of:
- Discovering new optimization strategies  
- Dynamically rewiring their own architectures  
- Unifying symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning
